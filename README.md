# Solving the Laplace Tidal Equations using Freely Available, Easily Extensible  Finite Element Software

# E. G. Sewell and V.C. Manea


#  Here we make fully available our Fortran codes for the scientific community and papers treating similar topics can benefit from the PDE2D flexible design. These codes can  all be run with the fully functional free demo PDE2D version (www.pde2d.com) which has a maximum limit for the unknowns set to 12000. The PDE2D program LTE_nonlinear.f, available as supplementary file, can be used to solve the eccentricity or obliquity tidal heating problem in the nonlinear case, CD > 0. LTE_linear.f solves the linear problem, CD = 0, efficiently. LTEice_linear.f solves the linear problem with the extra pressure equation to model the ice cap and LTEice_nonlinear.f solves the nonlinear problem with ice cap. Our Fortran PDE2D codes provided in this research paper are reusable and also extensible to a wide range of potential problems related with tidal heating. 

# Highlights

# 1) We study the use of General-purpose Finite Element Program (PDE2D) to solve Laplace Tidal Equations.
# 2) We calculate ocean dissipation in three icy satellites, Enceladus, Europa and Titan.
# 3) We show that modeling results using PDE2D can be a useful tool for researchers studying tidal heating related problems.
