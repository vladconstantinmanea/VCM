# Here we make fully available our Fortran codes for the scientific community, and papers treating similar topics can benefit from the PDE2D flexible design. These codes can also be run with the fully functional free demo PDE2D version (www.pde2d.com) which has a maximum limit for unknowns set to 12000. The PDE2D program LTE_nonlinear.f, available as supplementary file, can be used to solve the eccentricity or obliquity tidal heating problem in the nonlinear case, CD > 0. LTE_linear.f solves the linear problem, CD = 0, efficiently. Our Fortran PDE2D codes provided in this research paper are reusable and also extensible to a wide range of potential problems related with tidal heating.
